Hello! This is all my data science stuff. If one of my projects becomes large enough to warrant its own repo, I'll do that, but for now it's convenient to keep everything in one place.

I'll try to keep my code well documented so everything's clear, but just know that there are some unrelated things in here from cheminformatics to NLP to CV, etc.

ALso, I have a few different conda environments that I use. I've included a directory where you can find my different YAML files.

Thanks for reading!
